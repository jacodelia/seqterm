//! Z5Texture — live granular "texture engine" inspired by the *workflow* of
//! gesture/granular performance boxes (e.g. the Torso S-4 family): a continuously
//! written circular buffer scanned by a pool of windowed grains around an
//! independent **scrub** read head, with **Freeze** (hold the buffer = drones),
//! **Feedback** (resample its own grain output for layering), and **Stretch**
//! (the scrub head drifts slower/faster/backwards than real time).
//!
//! NOT a clone of any product's DSP — original implementation. It shares the
//! grain/circular-buffer skeleton with [`super::Protocosmos`] (so the two stay
//! consistent and cheap), but exposes a richer, *category-grouped* set of live
//! controls so a MIDI control surface can map ~8 knobs at a time.
//!
//! Params (flat index → grouped by the UI into categories):
//! ```text
//!   GRAIN : 0 Size  1 Density  2 Spray  3 Overlap  4 Pitch  5 RndPitch  6 Reverse  7 Spread
//!   MOTION: 8 Freeze 9 Feedbk  10 Stretch 11 Position 12 Drift 13 Blur   14 BufLen  15 Wet
//! ```
//!
//! Source = whatever audio is already on the slot's FX chain, i.e. the Pattern
//! voice (sample / synth / tracker). No global input is read. All buffers are
//! preallocated; the audio callback never allocates.
